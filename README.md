Gaussian.py, GRR.py, Laplace.py, SR.py, SW.py, and UE.py are the implementations of the **F** function and **G** function for the six mechanisms, respectively.

The experiments related to the **Table that illustrates F and G can generate correct distribution** can be conducted by

run Gaussian.py/GRR.py/Laplace.py/SR.py/SW.py/UE.py

Detailed explanation can be seen in the main.py

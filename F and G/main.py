#welcome to reuse-based peturbation

#The reuse method for six peturbations are shown in
#Gaussian, GRR, Laplace, SR, SW, UE, respectively

# XX_F corresponds to F function for perturbation XX
# XX_G corresponds to G function for perturbation XX


# was_22: the Was distance between two independent L_2
# was_12: the Was distance between L_2 and L_{1-2}
# p_22=0: the output of KS test between two independent L_2
# p_12=0: the output of KS test between L_2 and L_{1-2}
